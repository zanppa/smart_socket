This directory contains a simple browser based interface to control the socket via the [server](https://github.com/zanppa/smart_socket/tree/master/code/server_raspberrypi/communication).

The browser interface is built using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com). The server runs at port 5000 and can be accessed with any browser. There is buttons to turn relay 1 on or off, set the socket time and to schedule timed turn on/offs.
